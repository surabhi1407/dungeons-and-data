# 🧙‍♂️ Dungeons & Data

*Embark on a magical journey through SQL-powered dungeons!*

Welcome to **Dungeons & Data** — a fantasy-themed, story-driven SQL learning platform where each challenge is a quest, and every query you cast brings you one step closer to becoming the Grandmage of Data.

Whether you're a beginner data squire or a seasoned query wizard, this adventure will test your might with scrolls, dragons, and the sacred `SELECT * FROM scrolls`.
